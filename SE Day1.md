#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Answer : Software Engineering is a process applied in the development, testing and maintanance of software applications by applying engineering principles methods and tools. It is crucial in the development of High quality products that facilitates services such as automation and their maintenance  

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Answer : (i) The emergence of high level programming languages with programs like C that are more human readable. 
         (ii) The rise of object-oriented programming (OOP) 
         (iii) Agile methods which allowed interaction and collaboration between teams 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Answer : Requirements: Gathering all the required data documenting user needs and system requirements.
         Design: Is the creation process of quality and detailed designs of the software design and user interface.
         Implementation: It is when you start the actual programming of the software according to the design specification.
         Testing: This process is to ensure that the software meets quality standards and functional requirements through a series of tests.
         Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
         Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Answer : The waterfall methodology is a linear, step-by-step approach which makes it a useful method when with projects that are straigtforward and with a predictable timeline, while the Agile methodology is a flexible and frequantative which is more useful when working on projects with changing requirements and conditions.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Answer : Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
         Quality Assurance Engineer: Tests the software quality by designing and executing test plans.
         Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Answer : IDEs and VCS empower developers through workflow automation which allows them to automate certain tasks which saves time and boosts productivity. An example of an IDE is VSCODE and an example of a VCS is Git 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Answer : Limited time and Resources, rapid Technological advances and changing requirements. I believe one of the most important things in this fast paced careers we should adapt to is to constantly learn something new and automate as much as you can. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Answer : Unit Testing: Tests software modules  individually .
         Integration Testing: Tests if the functional requirements are met.
         System Testing: Testing the entire software system at once.
         Acceptance Testing: Tests the software if it functions according to user requirements, in the user environment to ensure it               meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Answer : It is a process designed to make it easier for AI to filter the user's prompt to ensure the relevance of the results in the 
        first prompt. It enhances the user-AI interaction so the AI understands the user's intention even with minimal input.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Answer : Provide me With a pizza recipe 

Answer : Provide me With a chicken and mushroom pizza recipe

The improved prompt narrows down the search to specific ingredients which i am looking to use and may have.
